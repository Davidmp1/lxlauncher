LXLauncher is an open source clone of Asus launcher for EeePC.
It outperformes the original launcher developed by Xandros.

Background images used by Asus launcher are non-free and are
hence not included in this package.

Please put the images in /usr/share/lxlauncher/backround.
LXLauncher will use those background images if available.
